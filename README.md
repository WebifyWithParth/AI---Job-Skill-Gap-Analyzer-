## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Job Recommendation System + Skill Gap Analyzer** is an intelligent web application that recommends relevant job opportunities based on user-entered skills and interests.

The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze job descriptions and compute similarity scores, while also identifying missing skills required for selected job roles.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters skills/interests.
2. The system vectorizes both user input and job descriptions using **TF-IDF**.
3. **Cosine similarity** is calculated to find the most relevant job matches.
4. The app displays:
   - Top matching jobs
   - Match percentage
   - Missing skills required to improve job fit
